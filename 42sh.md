This project is building a complete shell from scratch with POSIX features. It required Termcaps integration for advanced line editing as well as compound command evaluation, job control, and more!
This project was broken into the Termcaps team and the AST team with 2 per team. The AST team worked on building an AST from a command to fit bash grammar and then executing the AST.

# Objectives
|Name|TL;DR
|:-:|:-:|
|Process and interaction management|The AST allowed for advanced job control to suspend tasks and run them in the background/foreground|
|Command line and terminal management|Advanced line modification was required for this project. This included keybindings and modification across multiple lines.|
|Advanced parsing|Validation of Bash's grammar rules was performed during buildout for the AST. This required advanced error checking on values to ensure the meet spec.|
|Filesystem|We had to integrate not only with our own internalized systems but the system itself for environment variables and screen modification.|

# Skills
|Skill|How it was used
|:-:|:-:|
|Termcaps|Integration with Termcaps was required for the whole CLI to work. This included making our own line wrapping and screen management.|
|AST construction & evaluation|Making an AST to correctly evaluate bash's grammar rules as well as allow for easy execution made us, as a team, have to design a generalized AST structure to use for all execution operations.|
