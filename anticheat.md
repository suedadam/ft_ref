# Anti-Cheat

42, like every other school, had a cheating problem. A problem which was able to be solved with an automated system; however, one was not in place yet. To assist with this problem I assisted in the development of an anti-cheat system.
This system does assembly code analysis to compare assembly code against the whole student population's submitted code.
